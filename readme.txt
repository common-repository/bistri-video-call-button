== Description ==

Bistri is free video calling solution. Fully Open, no need to register to call a Bister.
Bistri runs in your browser, no need to install additional software or plugin.

The Bistri Video Call Button Widget allows you to add a "call me on Bistri" button on your blog.
A presence indicator integrated to the button let your visitors know about your availability for a call.

A few options give you the possibility to customize the button appearance (size, label, presence, ...)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do i need a Bistri account to use the button widget =

Yes, the button is linked to your Bistri account. If you don't have an account already, you can create one by visiting http://bistri.com

= Why the button presence indicator says that I'm online (green light) even if I set my status to away/busy =

For the time being the button can only show if you are online or offline because of technical restrictions. We will improve that as soon as possible
